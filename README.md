## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The project simulates a real-time feedback environment by processing pre-recorded CSV data row-by-row. The **Flask backend** processes the data, skipping rows at intervals to emulate real-time driving behavior. The **React frontend** presents this data to the user in an intuitive, live feedback display.

### ⚙️ Architecture Breakdown

1. **CSV Data Source**: Contains driving parameters like speed, acceleration, RPM, and fuel consumption.
2. **Backend (Flask)**:
   - Reads and processes data from the CSV in real-time.
   - Calculates an **eco-driving score** based on each trip.
   - Provides real-time feedback based on driving patterns.
3. **Frontend (React)**:
   - Displays the eco-driving score, trip summary, and coaching feedback.
   - Refreshes every 10 seconds to display new data, simulating real-time experience.

## 🗃️ Dataset Details

The dataset used for this simulation includes the following columns:

- **tripID**: Unique identifier for each trip
- **deviceID**: Identifier for the device collecting data
- **timestamp**: Time of data capture
- **acceleration**: Acceleration values
- **speed**: Vehicle speed
- **RPM**: Engine revolutions per minute
- **fuel usage**: Fuel consumption data
- Additional vehicle telemetry data as needed

This dataset enables the backend to calculate eco-driving scores and identify inefficient driving patterns for feedback.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** for Flask backend
- **Node.js and npm** for React frontend
- Python libraries: `flask`, `pandas`

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Backend Setup (Flask)
- Navigate to the backend directory.
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install flask pandas
  ```
- Run the Flask server:
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```

#### 2. Frontend Setup (React)
- Navigate to the frontend directory.
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Start the React development server:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

#### 3. Running the Simulation
- With both servers running, the frontend fetches data from the backend every 10 seconds, providing real-time feedback based on the simulated driving data in the CSV file.

## 📈 Eco-Driving Score Calculation
The eco-driving score is calculated based on a variety of driving metrics gathered throughout each trip. These metrics help assess driving behaviors that impact fuel efficiency and emissions. Here are the key columns used in determining the eco-driving score:
1. **Speed**: Helps to check if the driver maintains an optimal speed. Consistent speeds within an efficient range contribute positively, while overspeeding has a negative impact.
2. **Acceleration**: Indicates how smoothly the driver accelerates. Harsh accelerations consume more fuel, so smooth acceleration improves the eco-score.
3. **Braking**: Highlights how often and how harshly the driver brakes. Gentle, anticipatory braking is favorable, while hard braking events reduce the score.
4. **Harsh Acceleration**: Specific flag for severe acceleration events, indicating aggressive driving that negatively impacts fuel efficiency.
5. **Harsh Braking**: Flags aggressive braking events, which tend to correlate with inefficient driving and lower eco-scores.
6. **RPM** (Revolutions Per Minute): High RPM levels indicate that the engine is under strain, leading to less efficient fuel use. Lower RPM during cruising contributes positively.
7. **Throttle Position** (TPos): Measures the degree to which the accelerator pedal is pressed. High throttle input suggests aggressive driving, which may decrease the score.
8. **KPL** (Kilometers per Liter): Directly measures fuel efficiency during the trip, with higher values indicating eco-friendly driving patterns.
9. **Battery Temperature** (cTemp) and Engine Load (eLoad): Provide insight into engine strain, with consistently high values signaling inefficiency.
10. **Trip Duration and Trip Distance**: These values help analyze the overall consistency in eco-driving behavior across both short and long trips.

Each of these factors contributes to the cumulative eco-driving score, which is displayed at the end of each trip. This score provides an overview of how efficiently and safely the vehicle was driven, promoting eco-friendly driving habits.
